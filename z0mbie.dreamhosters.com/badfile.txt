
instruction:

  1. download badfile.zip (z0mbie.host.sk/badfile.zip)
  2. extract badfile.bin (NOTE: its just a duplicated 2048-byte array;
       probably any 8 byte read/stored at 8-aligned position is enough)
  3. write it to cd
  4. read

origin:

idea:
  append such a file to all .MP3 files and archives (at 8-aligned pos);
  insert such 8-byte signatures into own virii
