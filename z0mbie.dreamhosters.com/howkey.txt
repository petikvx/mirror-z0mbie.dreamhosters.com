                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  This text is not about PGP's -kg parameter. ;-)

  This text is about generating 3 numbers - D,E,N, which used in RSA
  encryption sheme.

  Well, if you are clever guy, you can read some fucking manuals and
  write program generating these fucking numbers.
  If you have nothing to do, you can download pgp sources & rip subroutines
  generating these fucking numbers.
  Also, you can try to extract these fucking numbers from the public/secret
  PGP keys, but then you will do blowjob with prompting password and
  decrypting secret key, which also requires reading manuals.

  So, how to generate these fucking three numbers?

  1. Take PGP 2.6.x
  2. Using '-l' command line option, or 'verbose = 2' line in config.txt,
     generate ('-kg') any PGP key -- all big numbers will be written
     to the screen.

  You will see something like that:

[...]
   0 * -Enough, thank you.
.............**** ................****
Key ID 78EDE91D
 modulus n = C3DD 2950 50B5 7800 9068 8F50 B05F B6CB ...
exponent e = 0011
Display secret components (y/N)?y
exponent d = 3F5E 23F4 5658 D400 2EB8 6A9A 1AF1 CA32 ...
[...]

  So, now you have fucking numbers.
  On the screen.
  If you're sucker, you will redirect standard output to some file.
  When i did two keys in such way, i understood -- it is sucks.
  Dont believe me? - try yourself.

  So, all you need is not love, but screen grabber.
  And program which will analyze output and convert produced numbers
  from text to binary or to anything else.
  The first one called SCRGRAB.COM, the second one is TXT2DEN.EXE.
  Both are available at http://z0mbie.host.sk

  To produce PGP output file:
  SCRGRAB outfile PGP.EXE -kg -l

  To get numbers from this file:
  TXT2DEN outfile

  Hmm, thats all.
  See this line? This means you must to pay me $5 for reading this text.
